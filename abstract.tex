\begin{abstract}
    This paper proposes a new deep learning based method for fingerprint recognition. A deep convolutional neural network is trained to extract local fingerprnt feature. This network can not only locate the local fingerprint region of interest, but also extract discriminative local feature, which is of significant importance for fingerprint matching. Graph neural network is used for fingerprint matching, which can robustly deal with fingerprint image noise. To our knowledge, this is the first work of applying graph neural network for fingerprint recognition. Conventional fingerprint matching uses hard coded matching algorithms, and those algorithms cannot compare with even minutiae pair based matching.
